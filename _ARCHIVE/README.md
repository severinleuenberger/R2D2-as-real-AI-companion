# R2D2 Documentation Archive

**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025

This folder contains historical and merged documentation files that have been superseded by the current documentation structure.

---

## Why These Files Are Archived

As of December 21, 2025, the R2D2 documentation was restructured to follow a consistent pattern:
- **Reference** - Complete technical documentation
- **Installation** - Setup and installation procedures
- **Quick Start** - Quick reference for daily use
- **Troubleshooting** - Debug procedures and solutions

The archived files were either:
1. **Merged** into new combined documents (e.g., 007, 100, 300 → new 100_PERCEPTION_STATUS_REFERENCE.md)
2. **Split** into focused documents (e.g., 009 → 103_PERCEPTION_STATUS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md + 203_SPEECH_SYSTEM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. **Completion documents** preserved for historical reference (e.g., 208, 310, TEMP_DISCREPANCIES)
