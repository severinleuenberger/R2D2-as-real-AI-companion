Guide: What to do if face recognition is not recognizing you

The system tests if it can recognize you at different distances.
Here's what happens and what to do.

FACE RECOGNITION TEST - WHAT HAPPENS
================================================================================

When you run the test, it will:

1. TEST AT 1 METER (Close Range)
   • Stand 1 meter from camera
   • Face forward
   • Move slightly (nod, turn left/right)
   • Shows: Faces detected, Correct recognitions, Confidence score

2. TEST AT 2 METERS (Medium Range)  
   • Stand 2 meters from camera
   • Same movements
   
3. TEST AT 3 METERS (Far Range)
   • Stand 3 meters from camera
   • Same movements

================================================================================
RESULTS INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

GOOD RESULT (>80% accuracy):
  ✅ System recognizes you!
  ✅ No action needed
  
POOR RESULT (0% accuracy):
  ⚠️  System doesn't recognize you
  
WHY THIS HAPPENS:
  • Training images were too limited (only 169 images)
  • Training images had different lighting/angles than test
  • Model needs more diverse training data

================================================================================
SOLUTION: CAPTURE MORE TRAINING DATA
================================================================================

To improve recognition, capture MORE images with VARIETY:

Step 1: From the menu, select [2] Capture images for person
        
Step 2: Choose "severin" (your existing person)

Step 3: System will say:
        "⚠️  Severin already has 169 images.
         New images will be added to existing dataset.
         Continue? (yes/no)"
         
        Type: yes
        
Step 4: Complete all 4 tasks:
        • Task 1: Bright Light - 1m (head: right, left, up, down)
        • Task 2: Bright Light - 2m (head: right, left, up, down)
        • Task 3: Low Light - 3m (head: right, left, up, down)
        • Task 4: Low Light - 5m (head: right, left, up, down)
        
        Total: ~80 more images
        
Step 5: Retrain the model:
        [3] Train model from existing images
        Choose "severin"
        
Step 6: Test again:
        [4] Test trained model
        Choose "severin"

================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

With ~250 total training images (different distances + lighting):
  • 1m: 85-95% accuracy ✅
  • 2m: 75-90% accuracy ✅
  • 3m: 60-80% accuracy ✅
  
With ~350+ images and more variety:
  • All distances: >90% accuracy ✅✅✅

================================================================================
KEY TIPS FOR BETTER TRAINING
================================================================================

1. VARIED LIGHTING
   - Train in bright light (sunny)
   - Train in low light (shadowed)
   - System will capture both automatically

2. VARIED DISTANCES
   - 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m
   - Helps recognize at any distance
   
3. VARIED HEAD ANGLES
   - Right, Left, Up, Down
   - Makes it work even if you're not facing camera directly
   
4. MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS
   - Each 4-task set captures ~80 images
   - Run 2-3 times for best results (200-240 images)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Option A: If recognition works (>80%)
  → Continue with real-world deployment!
  
Option B: If recognition doesn't work (0%)
  → Run [2] Capture again to add 80+ more images
  → Retrain and test again
  → Repeat until satisfied with accuracy

You can always run [2] Capture more times to keep improving!
