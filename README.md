## 🎯 Core Functional Requirements

The R2D2 project is designed to achieve the following functional capabilities:

### Communication & Conversation
- The robot must **listen to spoken input, convert speech to text, understand the user, generate a response, and speak it back** using text-to-speech
- The robot must **support natural, multi-turn conversation** without needing manual resets
- The robot must **allow direct verbal commands** such as "follow me," "go to the living room," "come here," or "look at this"
- The robot must **operate locally without requiring cloud services**, including offline STT, LLM, and TTS

### Perception & Recognition
- The robot must **recognize people, especially Severin, including detecting and identifying faces** through computer vision
- The robot must **track a person and optionally follow them** through the environment
- The robot must **recognize objects and obstacles** in front of it using camera and depth perception
- The robot must **detect rooms or general environment context** and understand where it is inside a home or office
- The robot must **react to events** in the environment, such as someone entering a room or calling its name
- The robot must **orient its camera** toward the person speaking or the object of interest

### Autonomous Navigation & Safety
- The robot must **autonomously navigate through indoor spaces, build a map, avoid obstacles, and move to requested locations**
- The robot must **maintain a safe driving speed and avoid collisions** with furniture, people, or pets
- The robot must **provide a heartbeat or "alive" signal** to indicate it is powered and operational

### Expression & Multi-Modal Interaction
- The robot must **respond with emotional or expressive sounds** similar to R2-D2 beeps
- The robot must **be able to play audio files**, including R2-D2 sound effects
- The robot must **combine perception, navigation, and conversation** so that it can interact socially and physically at the same time

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup (5 min)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:severinleuenberger/R2D2-as-real-AI-companion.git
cd R2D2-as-real-AI-companion

# Set up environment (CRITICAL: order matters!)
source ~/depthai_env/bin/activate
export OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=ARMV8
source ~/.bashrc
cd ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Launch Camera & Perception (1 command)

```bash
ros2 launch r2d2_bringup r2d2_camera_perception.launch.py
```

**Expected Output (first 5 seconds):**
```
[INFO] [camera_node]: OAK-D camera initialized
[INFO] [image_listener]: ImageListener node initialized
[INFO] [image_listener]: Haar Cascade loaded successfully
[INFO] All nodes started successfully
```

### 3. Verify System (In another terminal, same env setup as above)

```bash
# Check camera frame rate (should be ~30 Hz)
ros2 topic hz /oak/rgb/image_raw

# Check perception output (should be ~13 Hz)
ros2 topic hz /r2d2/perception/brightness

# See brightness values (should be ~130-140 in normal light)
watch -n 0.5 'ros2 topic echo /r2d2/perception/brightness -n 1'

# See face detection (0 = no one, 1+ = detected)
ros2 topic echo /r2d2/perception/face_count
```

### 4. Troubleshooting

If things don't work:
1. Check **[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)** section below or [001_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](001_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)
2. Verify environment setup: `echo $OPENBLAS_CORETYPE` should print `ARMV8`
3. Check camera: `lsusb | grep Movidius`

**Time to working system:** ~7 seconds from launch command
